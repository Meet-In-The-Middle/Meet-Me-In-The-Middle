MidUp with your Peeps.

## Sub-Heading ##
MidUp is the location app that makes it easy for friends and colleagues who are far apart to find the perfect place to meet up in the middle because we make it easy for you, your friend, and even an entire group to find suitable locations and easily decide with our built in voting feature.

## Summary ##
 MidUp helps you, your colleagues and your friends interactively find the perfect place to meet up in the middle.

## Problem ##
Ko, our project visionary, had a problem he wanted to solve. He found it very hard to coordinate meetups with his friends since everyone lived in different areas.  He wanted to create an application that would enable him and his friends to find a midpoint to meetup at, hence the applications name MidUp.    

## Solution ##
The application uses an intuitive interface to allow multiple users to interact with the same map, a midpoint calculator that allows users to find a central meeting place along with chatting and voting features that the users can use to decide on a perfect meeting spot.
  
## Quote from You ##
"We are glad that a problem experienced by one of our founders went from a simple idea to a full-fledged product that people can use to make it easier to get together and spend time with friends and colleagues"

## How to Get Started ##
Login and create a MidUp.  A Midup is an interactive map to find the perfect meetup spot. Send invitations to your friends, then click on the newly created MidUp link and you will be taken to your map.  Once you and your friends have joined the MidUp and specified your locations, a midpoint will be calculated.  From there you and your friends can search for, chat about and vote on locations to meet up around the midpoint. 

## Customer Quote ##
"What I love about MidUp is how easily I can make a plan with my friends for a great place to meet up. Before MidUp, it took multiple emails, chats, and even several phone calls to nail down a location. Now, we all pick our favorite places, vote on them, and the one with the most votes is where we get together.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
Next time you have a meet up with friends or colleagues, use MidUp the tool to use to find the perfect place to meet up in the middle.
